## Synopsis

The most accesible financial instrument in modern finance is the index fund. An
index fund is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) is
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund]("designed to follow certain preset rules so that the fun can track a specified basket of underlying investments"),
usually a popular index for a market. Because these
funds are derivative products with many component parts, frequently including
many mutual funds, themselves composed of some combination of mutual funds,
these funds allow both a relatively safe investment for the average investor,
but they also have a tricky problem in that users' investment in tens,
hundreds, or thousands of stocks are frequently only hazily visible. The
private prison industry is understood by many to be ethically dubious, and some
of the most accessible firms have large holdings in the two publically traded
private prison companies, GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW, formerly known as
Corrections Corporation of America). In order to facilitate users divestment
from Vanguard index funds that are involved with these two and other ethically
dubious stock holdings, this code base seeks to facilitate scraping of public
access data to trace holdings in stocks of interest to their top level Vanguard
index fund products.
